# **Introduction**

Here, I have worked with the built-in `iris` dataset that comes with R. It’s a well-known dataset often used in beginner data science examples, and it contains measurements of flowers from three iris species — *setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*. For each flower, we get four features: **sepal length**, **sepal width**, **petal length**, and **petal width**, all measured in centimeters. This dataset is ideal for visual pattern recognition and classification practice.


# **Quick Summary of the Data**

Before jumping into any plotting, I wanted to get a quick sense of what the dataset looks like. Here are a few key points:

-   There are 3 different species in the dataset\
-   **Petal.Length** values range from 1.0 cm to 6.9 cm\
-   **Petal.Width** ranges from 0.1 cm to 2.5 cm

Based on this, I decided to focus on the petal measurements since they seem quite useful for comparing the species.

# **Plotting Petal Length vs Width**

So in this section, I’ve made a scatter plot that shows how *Petal.Length* and *Petal.Width* relate to each other across the three species. I used `ggplot2` for this because it makes it really easy to add colour and style.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Create the scatter plot
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Petal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Petal Length vs Width by Species",
    x = "Petal Length (cm)",
    y = "Petal Width (cm)",
    caption = "Data: Built-in iris dataset | Viz: Rajveer Mishra"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

This scatter plot shows the relationship between petal length and width for three iris species.

-   `Setosa (red)` is clearly separated in the bottom-left — small petals and no overlap with others.

-   `Versicolor (green)` sits in the middle with moderate petal size and some overlap.

-   `Virginica (blue)` has the largest petals and appears in the top-right.

Overall, the plot shows a strong pattern — petal size is a good way to tell the species apart.
